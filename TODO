Things To Do
 - Implement interactive system. Use Clunk? Would add external dependencies...
 - lib/primary.rb, line 32-35. There has to be a better way for striping the "s of both ends of the string. Anyone? please? x.gsub('\"', '') ? Maybe?
 - Add some tests. We can test this stuff!
 - Add loops. Only add while? Other things?
 - Change exec to work with the next command so we can raise an error when nothing happens with a particular section of code

 - Decide which features will be in the next version. Move the other TODOs to the "future version"

Things Done:
c- Add multiplication and division to builtins
c- Complete "semi-if" system, and ship next version with it disabled if it doesn't work, enabled if it does.
c- Implement full argument parsing system, including version and license
c- Add in code documentation, as well as rdoc
c- In the semi-if section of exec, should we check to see if the rorth code should be executed before we read the code into seperate memory? This would improve performance.
c- Errors for unfound words/primaries.


Things for the future:
 - Automated documentation system.
 - Ability to do prepass to define words, and other preprocessing stuff before executing code.
 - Implement multiple stacks feature

Hazy suggestions:
 - Debug option is a bit crazy about what it does, exactly. Do something about it?
 - Implement more interesting, and more useful, header system.
 - Add more information to README.textile
 - Comments. Include them in the automatic documentation software?
