Things To Do
 - Implement more interesting, and more useful, header system.
 - Complete "semi-if" system, and ship next version with it disabled if it doesn't work, enabled if it does.
 - Implement full argument parsing system, including version and license
 - Add in code documentation, as well as rdoc
 - Add multiplication and division to builtins
 - Implement multiple stacks feature
 - Add more information to README.textile
 - Implement interactive system. Use Clunk? Would add external dependencies...
